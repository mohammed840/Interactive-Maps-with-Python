# explanation
In my perspective, Python is the top language of programming and has fantastic libraries. Recently, I learned about the folium package/library, which enables you to obtain dynamic maps with markers, parachutes, and much more! Additionally, these interactive maps are available in HTML format, which you can save and add to your website!





# requirements
Python 3.7 version or later;



Folium package/library.







# Tips
